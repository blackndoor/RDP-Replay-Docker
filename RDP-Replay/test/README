There are 2 demo pcap files in this directory.

Both files were recorded locally, and (due to ckecksum offloading) will need to be
processed with the --no_cksum flag.

The first demo show extraction of SSL and DPAPI private keys from a Windows-7
box. The session is SSL based.

  rdp_replay -r demo1.pcap -p demo1.pem --no_cksum

The second demo has sound. It's the same Windows-7 box, but the pcap this time
is based on RC4, so we use the binary key pulled out with extractrdpkeys.

  rdp_replay -r demo2.pcap -L demo2.bin --sound --no_cksum


Feel free to play around with other parameters (--show_keys and --show_time
as examples).

Enjoy.
